ptv-scraper
===========

A Web Scraper built in Python (v2.7) that will create a database of the train data from the [Public Transport Victoria](http://ptv.vic.gov.au/) website, for use in various applications.

The SQLite database follows the schema from the original PTV database that shipped with the old official iOS app.
